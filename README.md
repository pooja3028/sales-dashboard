## Data Model

The dashboard is built on a clean **star schema** structure:

- **Fact Tables**:
  - `D-Sales`: Sales data
  - `D-Returns`: Return data

- **Dimension Tables**:
  - `Product`, `Customer`, `Territory`, `Calendar`

This setup ensures correct filtering, better performance, and accurate DAX calculations.

## Business Logic (Key Measures)

Some of the key DAX measures used:

- **Revenue**  
  `SUMX('D-Sales', 'D-Sales'[Units] * RELATED('Product'[ProductPrice]))`

- **Return Rate**  
  `SUM('D-Returns'[ReturnQuantity]) / SUM('D-Sales'[Units])`

- **Discounted Price (10%)**  
  `ROUND('Product'[ProductPrice] * 0.9, 0)`

These help estimate actual earnings, return losses, and future pricing strategies.
